## Features
In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so. You will need to explain what value each of the features provides for the user, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

### Existing Features
* Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is an essential feature that provides easy and intuitive access to different sections of the website. For the users, it helps them easily navigate through the website and find the information they are looking for without any confusion. The navigation bar in this project will have links to various pages such as home, about, news, events, contact, and sign up. It will ensure that users can quickly find the specific information they want about the badminton club, making their browsing experience efficient and user-friendly.

* The landing page image

The landing page image serves as the focal point of the website and immediately grabs the attention of the users. It provides a visual representation of the badminton club, showing the facilities, atmosphere, or a captivating action shot, which can create an emotional connection with the users. The image helps the users gauge whether the club aligns with their interests and preferences. By showcasing the club's ambiance, it allows potential members to visualize themselves being a part of the club and promotes a desire to explore further.

* Club Ethos Section

The club ethos section is where the badminton club communicates its values, principles, and the overall atmosphere it creates for its members. This section is crucial for users who are interested in joining the club as it gives them insight into the club's culture and what they can expect. By highlighting the club's ethos, such as promoting sportsmanship, teamwork, and personal growth, the users can determine whether the club's values align with their own. This helps them make an informed decision about joining the club and ensures that the club attracts members who resonate with their values.

* Meetup Times section

This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the run will be in kilometers.
This section will be updated as these times change to keep the user up to date.

* The Footer

The footer is a consistent feature that appears at the bottom of every webpage. It provides valuable information and links that users may need to access regardless of which page they are on. In this project, the footer can include important details such as contact information, social media links, privacy policy, and terms of service. The footer ensures that users can easily find essential information without navigating back to the main menu or searching through the entire website. It increases usability, saves users time, and improves their overall experience.

* The Sign Up Page

The sign up page is critical for individuals who want to join the badminton club. It provides a streamlined and organized way for users to express their interest in becoming a member. By having a dedicated sign up page, users can input their personal information, specify their preferences or level of play, and indicate their availability. This helps the club in managing their membership database effectively and allows them to cater to the needs and interests of different individuals. The sign-up page is convenient for users, as they don't have to contact or communicate with the club separately, and it streamlines the membership process, facilitating a smooth onboarding experience.

Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
