## Demo

## UX
There are two user groups targeted by this website. They are prosepective members and existsing ones. 
The site is focused on simplicity and ease of navigation so users can find the information they need. 

## User stories
As the sole developer of this website, my goal is to successfuly advertise the badminton club to prosepctive members as well as help establish the club in the forefront of the local community. 
I came up with the following points, which are applicable to the users:

- As a user, I want to understand the purpose of this website quickly and easily.
- As a user, I want to easily navigate this website (by using a mouse, a keyboard, or a touch screen).
- As a user, I want to see what the club can offer me
- As a user, I want to know what the club will provide me for my membersip fee.
- As a user, I want to know when the training sessions are.
- As a user, I want to know how much the memebrship fees cost. 
- As a user, I want a way to contact this club.
- As a user, I want to know where the club is located.

### Strategy
The goal is to make a well-functioning professional website for a badminton club. The focus was on making the design both user-friendly and pleasing to the eye..

### Scope
For the users, I wanted to give them a good overview of the club and its offerings, focusing on club ethos, details regarding training sessions, location and contact information. This way, the users will get a picture about what the club is about and whether they would be interested in becoming a part of it.

## Features

### Existing Features
* Navigation Bar
The navigation bar is an essential feature that provides easy and intuitive access to different sections of the website. For the users, it helps them easily navigate through the website and find the information they are looking for without any confusion. The navigation bar in this project has links to home, timetable, sign-up and contact. It will ensure that users can quickly find the specific information they want about the badminton club, making their browsing experience efficient and user-friendly. The navigation bar will also transform into a dropdown menu once the screen size reaches below 804 pixels wide. This has been done to conserve real estate on the page and henhance the viewing experience.

* The landing page image
The landing page image serves as the focal point of the website and immediately grabs the attention of the users. It provides a visual representation of the badminton club, showing the main focal point of the sport. The image helps the users gauge whether the club aligns with their interests and preferences. By showcasing the club's ambiance, it allows potential members to visualize themselves being a part of the club and promotes a desire to explore further.

* Club Ethos Section
The club ethos section is where the badminton club communicates its values, principles, and the overall atmosphere it creates for its members. This section is crucial for users who are interested in joining the club as it gives them insight into the club's culture and what they can expect. By highlighting the club's ethos, such as promoting sportsmanship, teamwork, and personal growth, the users can determine whether the club's values align with their own. This helps them make an informed decision about joining the club and ensures that the club attracts members who resonate with their values.

* Meetup Times section
This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the run will be in kilometers.
This section will be updated as these times change to keep the user up to date.

* The Sign Up section
The sign up page is critical for individuals who want to join the badminton club. It provides a streamlined and organized way for users to express their interest in becoming a member. By having a dedicated sign up page, users can input their personal information, specify their preferences or level of play, and indicate their availability. This helps the club in managing their membership database effectively and allows them to cater to the needs and interests of different individuals. The sign-up page is convenient for users, as they don't have to contact or communicate with the club separately, and it streamlines the membership process, facilitating a smooth onboarding experience.

* The Contact and Map section
The contact and map section contains the address of the club as well as the telephone number and email address. This is paired with a visual represenattion of the clubs location in the form of a google map import. This section shpould contain all the information the user would need to contact the club and locate them. 

![contact/map_section](/assets/readme-assets/contact_map.png)

* The Footer
The footer is a consistent feature that appears at the bottom of every webpage. It provides valuable information and links that users may need to access regardless of which page they are on. In this project, the footer can include important details such as contact information, social media links, privacy policy, and terms of service. The footer ensures that users can easily find essential information without navigating back to the main menu or searching through the entire website. It increases usability, saves users time, and improves their overall experience.

### Features Left to Implement
In the future I would like to add, 
* Another section which showcases the instructors. This could include a short bio written by each of them and photo. This increases personability of the club hopefully encouraging prospective members to register.
* A separate page where individual existing club members could reserve badminton courts outside the normal club hours. This page would include a calendar style booking platform. Additionally there would be a section displaying the rental fees per hour and any terms of conduct. This section would provide existing members with extra flexibility to practice badmintion which would hopefully be attractive to prospective members due to busy schedules.

## Testing
* I tested the site, and it works in different web browsers: Chrome, Firefox, and Microsoft Edge.
* On mobile devices, I tested the my site on a Samsung Galaxy S23 Ultra with the Samsung browser and an iPhone SE with the Safari browser.
* I confirmed that the site is responsive and functions on different screen sizes using the devtools device toolbar.
* I confirmed that the navigation and the sections Home, Experience, Education, Skills, and Contact are readable and easy to understand.
* I confirmed that the form works: it requires entries in every field, only accepts an email in the email field, and both the submit and reset buttons work.
* I confirmed that the Download CV link will download the pdf copy of the traditional CV to the device on which the site is open.

Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
* The site was deployed to Git Hub pages using the following steps:
  - In the Github repository, the Stetting tab.
  - Under General, navigate to Code and Automation and select 'Pages'.
  - In the Build and Deployment section for Source, select 'Deploy from a branch' from the drop-down list.
  - For Branch, select 'main' from the drop-down list and Save.
  - On the top of the page, the link to the complete website is provided.
  
* The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
