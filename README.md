## Features

### Existing Features
* Navigation Bar

The navigation bar is an essential feature that provides easy and intuitive access to different sections of the website. For the users, it helps them easily navigate through the website and find the information they are looking for without any confusion. The navigation bar in this project has links to home, timetable, sign-up and contact. It will ensure that users can quickly find the specific information they want about the badminton club, making their browsing experience efficient and user-friendly. The navigation bar will also transform into a dropdown menu once the screen size reaches below 804 pixels wide. This has been done to conserve real estate on the page and henhance the viewing experience. 

* The landing page image

The landing page image serves as the focal point of the website and immediately grabs the attention of the users. It provides a visual representation of the badminton club, showing the main focal point of the sport. The image helps the users gauge whether the club aligns with their interests and preferences. By showcasing the club's ambiance, it allows potential members to visualize themselves being a part of the club and promotes a desire to explore further.

* Club Ethos Section

The club ethos section is where the badminton club communicates its values, principles, and the overall atmosphere it creates for its members. This section is crucial for users who are interested in joining the club as it gives them insight into the club's culture and what they can expect. By highlighting the club's ethos, such as promoting sportsmanship, teamwork, and personal growth, the users can determine whether the club's values align with their own. This helps them make an informed decision about joining the club and ensures that the club attracts members who resonate with their values.

* Meetup Times section

This section will allow the user to see exactly when the meetups will happen, where they will be located and how long the run will be in kilometers.
This section will be updated as these times change to keep the user up to date.

* The Sign Up section

The sign up page is critical for individuals who want to join the badminton club. It provides a streamlined and organized way for users to express their interest in becoming a member. By having a dedicated sign up page, users can input their personal information, specify their preferences or level of play, and indicate their availability. This helps the club in managing their membership database effectively and allows them to cater to the needs and interests of different individuals. The sign-up page is convenient for users, as they don't have to contact or communicate with the club separately, and it streamlines the membership process, facilitating a smooth onboarding experience.

* The Contact and Map section

The contact and map section contains the address of the club as well as the telephone number and email address. This is paired with a visual represenattion of the clubs location in the form of a google map import. This section shpould contain all the information the user would need to contact the club and locate them. 

* The Footer

The footer is a consistent feature that appears at the bottom of every webpage. It provides valuable information and links that users may need to access regardless of which page they are on. In this project, the footer can include important details such as contact information, social media links, privacy policy, and terms of service. The footer ensures that users can easily find essential information without navigating back to the main menu or searching through the entire website. It increases usability, saves users time, and improves their overall experience.

### Features Left to Implement

* Another section which showcases the instructors. This could include a short bio written by each of them and photo. This increases personability of the club hopefully encouraging prospective members to register.
* A separate page where individual existing club members could reserve badminton courts outside the normal club hours. This page would include a calendar style booking platform. Additionally there would be a section displaying the rental fees per hour and any terms of conduct. This section would provide existing members with extra flexibility to practice badmintion which would hopefully be attractive to prospective members due to busy schedules.

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your projectâ€™s features and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

### Validator Testing
HTML
No errors were returned when passing through the official W3C validator

CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator
Unfixed Bugs

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed. This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used. Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

## Deployment
This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub)

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:
In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
